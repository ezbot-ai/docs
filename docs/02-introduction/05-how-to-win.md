# How to Win with ezbot

After installing ezbot, you're ready to start optimizing your website or app. Here's how to win with ezbot:

1. **Identify areas of improvement:** Using existing analytics, gut-feel, or customer feedback, identify areas of your website or app that could be improved. Where do you have friction? Where do you have drop-offs? Where do you have low conversion rates?

2. **Create variations:** Think about what you want to change to address that friction, like button placements, content variations, design layouts, or pricing. The only limit to what you can test with ezbot is your imagination. Then, create the variations in our Visual Editor or in your code.

3. **Sit back and relax:** Ezbot continuously tests combinations of your variations, learns which combinations are best for each kind of user, and automatically delivers winning experiences.

4. **Embrace a "let's try it" culture:** With Ezbot, testing is quick, safe, and data-driven without time-consuming analyses, so why not just skip the debate and try it?

5. **See your metrics improve:** Ezbot identifies winning combinations ramps up traffic to them, and captures more value for you, while ramping down traffic to under-performers to limit risk.
