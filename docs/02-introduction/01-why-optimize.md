# Why Optimize?

Imagine you have a website or app with a specific goal, like selling products or engaging visitors. Once it's live, the real challenge begins: optimizing it to achieve those goals. Even the smallest changes, like the size or color of a call-to-action button, can significantly impact how users behave and affect your business outcomes. This is where ezbot comes in, helping you test different versions of your website or app to see what works best for your audience and get better results.

The tricky part about optimization is that users often don't know what they want, but they sure know when something isn't meeting their expectations. What works for one site or app might not work for another, and whatâ€™s effective today might not be tomorrow.

The key to unlocking your website or appâ€™s full potential is continuous experimentation and optimization.

Rather than relying on guesswork or gut feelings, digital businesses often use experimentation to test their ideas and make data-driven decisions. This approach helps them understand what resonates with their audience, improve their website or app's performance, and deliver a better experience to their users.

**Digital experimentation** involves systematically testing various elements of your website or app to find out which versions of a single feature resonate best with your audience and drive desired outcomes, like more conversions, better engagement, or higher revenue.

In traditional experimentation, you start with a hypothesis, design an experiment, collect data, and analyze it to see if there's enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

The simplest form of digital experimentation is A/B testing, where you compare two versions of a webpage or app to see which one performs better. Digital experimentation now includes more complex testing methods, like multivariate testing and bandit algorithms, and supports use cases like personalization.

Ultimately, the goal of experimentation is to help you make data-driven decisions that improve your website or app's performance and give your users a better experience.

When you repeat the process of experimentation over time, experimentation becomes **optimization**: a continuous cycle of testing, learning, and improving that helps you achieve your goals and deliver the best possible experience to your users.
