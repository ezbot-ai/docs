# Our Mission

At ezbot, our mission is to empower everyone to test their ideas and eliminate poor user experiences on all websites and apps. Digital businesses use ezbot to experiment with new concepts, understand what works, and deliver exceptional user experiences to their customers.

## Three Key Insights Behind ezbot

ezbot was founded because of three key insights:

1. Experimentation is essential for making data-driven decisions, but it is often too challenging, time-consuming, and expensive for most companies.
2. People are generally poor at predicting which user experience will perform best. (Try [Guessing The Test](https://guessthetest.com/archived-tests/) yourself!).
3. The number of variations tested is the best predictor of return on investment (ROI) in experimentation programs, but the more concurrent variations you test, the more complex it becomes. You can learn more about the value of experimentation [here](https://www.optimizely.com/the-evolution-of-experimentation/).

## Core Beliefs

At ezbot, we believe:

1. Users deserve the best possible experience.
2. Digital businesses thrive when their users have optimal experiences.
3. User preferences are diverse, so a one-size-fits-all approach won't cut it.
4. All websites and apps can be improved.
5. The only way to know what works is to put it to the test.
6. Testing new ideas should be simple and low risk.
7. Everyone should have the power to test their ideas.

## The "just try it" mentality

Here at ezbot, we encourage a "just try it" mentality. We believe that the best _and only_ way to know if something works is to test it. Instead of debating endlessly about what might work, we encourage you to test your ideas early and often to see what works best for your users.

**Our product supports the "just try it" mentality by:**

1. Making it easy to test new ideas.
2. Reducing the risk of testing bold ideas by continuously monitoring and adjusting.
3. Testing numerous combinations of your ideas to identify the most effective one.

You never know what will work until you try it, so why not give it a shot with ezbot?
