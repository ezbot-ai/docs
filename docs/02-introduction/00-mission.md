# Our Mission

At ezbot, our mission is to empower everyone to test their ideas and eliminate poor user experiences on all websites and apps. Digital businesses use ezbot to experiment with new concepts, understand what works, and deliver exceptional user experiences to their customers.

## Two Key Insights Behind ezbot

ezbot was founded because of two key insights:

1. Experimentation is essential for making data-driven decisions, but it is often too challenging, time-consuming, and expensive.
2. The more ideas you test the higher your chance of success, but the more complex it becomes to manage.

You can learn more about the value of experimentation [here](https://www.optimizely.com/the-evolution-of-experimentation/).

## Core Beliefs

At ezbot, we believe:

1. Users deserve the best possible experience.
2. Digital businesses thrive when their users have optimal experiences.
3. User preferences are diverse, so a one-size-fits-all approach won't cut it.
4. All websites and apps can be improved.
5. The only way to know what works is to put it to the test.
6. Testing new ideas should be simple and low risk.
7. Everyone should have the power to test their ideas.

## The "just try it" mentality

Here at ezbot, we encourage a "just try it" mentality. We believe that the best _and only_ way to know if something works is to test it. Instead of debating endlessly about what might work, we encourage you to test your ideas early and often to see what works best for your users.

**Our product supports this mentality by:**

1. **Automating Experimentation:** Making it incredibly easy to test new ideas with minimal effort.
2. **Mitigating Risk:** Continuously monitoring and adjusting to reduce the risks associated with test new ideas.
3. **Optimizing Holistically:** Testing numerous combinations of your ideas to identify the most effective overall user experience for each kind of user.

You never know what will work until you try it, so why not give it a shot with ezbot?
