# Our Mission

At ezbot, weâ€™re on a mission to give people everywhere the power to test their ideas and eradicate bad user experiences on all websites and apps. Digital businesses everywhere use ezbot to test new ideas, learn what works, and deliver winning user experiences to their customers.

## We started ezbot because:

1. **People are terrible at predicting which user experience will perform best** (Try [Guessing The Test](https://guessthetest.com/archived-tests/) yourself!).
2. **The #1 predictor of ROI on experimentation programs is the number of variations tested.** You can learn more about the value of experimentation [here](https://www.optimizely.com/the-evolution-of-experimentation/).

## Core Beliefs

At ezbot, we believe:

1. Users deserve the best possible experience.
2. Digital businesses thrive when their users have optimal experiences.
3. User preferences are diverse, so a one-size-fits-all approach won't cut it.
4. All websites and apps can be improved.
5. The only way to know what works is to put it to the test.
6. Testing new ideas should be effortless and risk-free.
7. Everyone should have the power to test their ideas.

## The "just try it" mentality

Here at ezbot, we encourage a "just try it" mentality. We believe that the best _and only_ way to know if something works is to test it. Instead of debating endlessly about what might work, we encourage you to test your ideas to the test early and often to see what works best for your users.

**Our product is built for the "just try it" mentality because it:**

1. Makes it as easy as possible to test new ideas.
2. Reduces the risk of trying new things by continuously monitoring and adjusting.
3. It tests as many combinations of your ideas as possible to find the best one.

You never know what will work until you try it, so why not give it a shot with ezbot?
