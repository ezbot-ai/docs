# How ezbot Works

ezbot is an artificial intelligence system that watches over your website. When a user lands on your page, ezbot watches them navigate it and learns from their behavior. Because ezbot can watch thousands of users interact with a website at the same time, it can serve different websites to different users to learn what they like and guide them through an optimal user experience.

<summary>**Example: Users Have Different Preferences Based On Weather**</summary>  
<div>  
<div>Imagine you have a small souvenir shop with two items: baseball caps and beanies. They're very popular and people all over the US buy them. After a while, ezbot would notice that people with IP addresses in warm weather buy more baseball caps, and people with IP addresses in cold weather buy more beanies. Eventually, ezbot will be able to suggest beanies to people in certain locations and baseball caps to the others.  </div>  
<br/>  
From the perspective of the users there hasn't been much change. Some people will still buy beanies when it's hot out or baseball caps when it's cold. The important change is that before ezbot, there were some people in warm climates who saw beanies first and left the page, or saw baseball caps from

## Serving What Works

After a user has created a **project** and **variations** to try, ezbot can start working its magic. It starts off by serving **variations** to users that are not in the **holdback** group, and watches what users do with each **variation** of the site. As more people visit the site, ezbot can spot patterns and learn which **variations** worked best for users with specific **attributes**. Then, when someone lands on your website, ezbot will serve them the **variation** that will maximize your **reward strategy**.

## Keeping Up With Changing Preferences

Your website will not only serve different **variations** to users with different **attributes**, but will also be able to serve different **variations** at different times. People may prefer different messaging, layouts, or colors at different times of day or during different seasons. ezbot automatically notices these preference changes and will continue to serve the optimal **variations** for people over time.

## Get Started Quickly

ezbot works on any website with any framework, so you can start using ezbot the day you sign up. There are two ways to use ezbot: with a visual (WYSIWYG) editor or through our REST API.

If you want to use the visual editor, then you'll need to install the JavaScript Snippet or node SDK. If you want to use the REST API directly, you do not need to install anything. For more details, check out the next [section on getting started](04-getting-started.md).
