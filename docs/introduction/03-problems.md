# Problems with Traditional Experimentation

## It's Hard

## It's Slow

## It's Expensive

**People are really bad at predicting what other people will do on their websites.** There are games like [guessthetest.com](https://guessthetest.com/archived-tests/) that highlight how bad people are at this. Furthermore, the more changes you make on your website, the harder it is to predict what people will do. Which checkout button will drive the most sales? What headlines will get people to read more articles?

**Experimentation is supposed to solve this problem but it's really hard to do.** Instead of guessing what will happen if you change your website, you can plan experiments and test which version works best. This sounds easy and straightforward but requires a lot of expertise: programming, data analysis, statistics, and experimental design.
If you want to run multiple experiments at the same time, then you need a LOT of people with time and expertise.

**The more changes you try, the better your website will perform.** This is why businesses hire expensive teams to run experimentation programs in order to optimize their websites. This is a no-brainer: Even though optimization is really hard and expensive, it's worth experimenting to get an optimized website.

# Optimization for Everyone

Computers and Artificial Intelligence have made it easier for people to do tedious tasks like accounting, filing taxes, collecting data, generating reports, balancing checkbooks, and calculating tips. Today, the majority of people use computers for these tasks because they're so much faster than humans, and they make fewer mistakes.

Think of ezbot as your optimization calculator. **You don't need an experimentation expert to optimize your website anymore, because ezbot does this for you.** All you need to do is decide what layouts, designs, copy, or pricing you want to try, and ezbot will serve the best versions of your website. With ezbot, one person can try more changes on their site in one week than whole experimentation teams could test in a month.

**People are free to generate ideas; ezbot does the math to figure out which ideas make you the most money.**
