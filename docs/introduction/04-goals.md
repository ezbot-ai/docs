# Goals

At ezbot, weâ€™re on a mission to give people everywhere the power to test their ideas and eradicate bad user experiences on all websites and apps. We built ezbot to help businesses focus on the details that matter most.

Instead of carving up traffic first and running experiments to learn what works for whom, ezbot allows businesses to improve KPIs first, and dig into the details later. By directing ezbot to maximize the goals of your website, businesses can deliver winning user experiences to their customers quickly and easily.

ezbot was formed around two key premises:

1. **People are terrible at predicting which user experience will perform best** (Try [Guessing The Test](https://guessthetest.com/archived-tests/) yourself!).
2. **The #1 predictor of ROI on experimentation programs is the number of variations tested.** You can learn more about the value of experimentation [here](https://www.optimizely.com/the-evolution-of-experimentation/).

Because of this, ezbot prioritizes making it easy for you to test as many variations as possible in order to deliver as much value as possible.
