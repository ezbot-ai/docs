# Benefits of Optimizing with ezbot

## Get Started Quickly and Easily

ezbot works with any website, app, and framework, so users can get started quickly. Signing up and installing ezbot is simple, so users can start using ezbot the day they sign up.

### Two Ways to Use ezbot

ezbot comes in two forms:

- **Visual Editor**: Designed to empower _non-technical_ users to create and run experiments on websites without writing code.
- **REST API**: For developers who want to use ezbot's powerful optimization engine directly, anywhere in their stack.

Both forms are powered by the same platform. To use our Visual Editor, you'll need to install the JavaScript Snippet or browser SDK. For more details, check out the next [section on getting started.](/getting-started)

## No More Guessing

**Try Everything and Learn What Actually Works**

With traditional experimentation tools, digital businesses must be sparing with the experiments they run due to the cost of each experiment in terms of traffic and internal resources needed to develop, run, and analyze each experiment. Experimenters have to guess which variations will perform best so they can prioritize their limited _traffic budget_ on experiments with the best chance of providing statistically significant results â€“ or so they think.

With ezbot, it's so easy to test another variation that experimenters can try out all of their ideas and find out which ones actually work best. Because ezbot tests continuously, ezbot eliminates the need to run fewer experiments. Ezbot does not need you to limit your creativity or guess the results of experiments before they're even run.

## One Size Does Not Fit All

Most experiments today are run in order to find out which single version of your website will perform best overall. This means that the "winner" of your experiments will be served to everyone that lands on your site.

However, ezbot understands that not everyone has the same preferences. In an [example](03-how-it-works.md) on the next page, you can see how different users may have different preferences for hats or other clothing types based on the weather in their locations. **With ezbot, your website can differentiate between different kinds of users and serve them different website based on their preferences.**

## User Preferences Change

When experiments are run in the traditional way, they have a start and an end date. This means that when an experiment is over no more data will be taken into account and if user preferences change you won't know it unless you run new experiments.

**Since ezbot never stops keeping track of what works for users on your website, it will adapt quickly to changing user preferences.** If, for example, an item goes our of style or a change in the weather causes user preferences to change, ezbot will notice and figure out which website variation works best to match these new preferences.
