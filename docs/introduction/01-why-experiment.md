# Why Optimize?

Most websites and apps are built with a specific goal in mind, such as selling products or services or engaging visitors. Once a website or app is live, the challenge becomes optimizing it to achieve those goals. What makes this even more challenging is that users often donâ€™t know what they want, even though they know when an experience fails to meet their expectations. What works for one website or app may not work for another, and what works today may not work tomorrow.

**The key to unlocking the full potential of your website or app is continuous experimentation and optimization.**

Digital experimentation is the process of systematically testing various elements of your website or app to causally identify what resonates best with your audience and drives desired outcomes, such as increased conversions, engagement, or revenue.

In traditional experimentation, a hypothesis is formulated, an experiment is designed, and data is collected and analyzed to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

The simplest form of digital experimentation is A/B testing, where two versions of a webpage or app are compared to determine which performs better. Digital experimentation has grown to encompass more complex testing methodologies, such as multivariate testing and bandit algorithms, and to support use cases such as personalization.

In the end, the goal of experimentation is to help you make data-driven decisions that improve the performance of your website or app and deliver a better experience for your users.

**When repeated over time, experimentation becomes optimization: a continuous process of testing, learning, and improving** that helps you achieve your goals and deliver the best possible experience to your users.
