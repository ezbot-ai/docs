# Getting Results

The home page of every ezbot project has a dashboard that shows you how ezbot is performing in simple terms with North Star Metrics. There are also analytics tools to visualize your optimization efforts and outcomes with ezbot: **Traffic Distribution** and **Conversion Rate Improvement**.

These features are still under active development. If you would like to see a specific feature or have any feedback, please let us know at [support@ezbot.ai](mailto:support@ezbot.ai).

## North Star Metrics

### Additional Conversions

We estimate how many more conversions you're getting by summing the number of conversions you get from optimized traffic less the number of conversions you get from the holdback group.

### Predictions

The number of predictions we've served to your website or application.

### Sessions

The number of sessions we've seen on your website or application.

### Revenue (coming soon)

Soon, we will add a North Star Metric to show you how much more **revenue** you're getting.

## Graphs

**Note:** The graphs below are reflect development data. You would expect to see a positive number of conversions and prettier graphs in a real-world scenario. We look forward to updating this image soon.

### Traffic Distribution

The traffic distribution graph shows what percentage of your traffic is receiving each **variation**. Generally, you should expect the best (highest-performing) **variations** to receive a larger percentage of traffic. In other words, the traffic distribution percentage of a variation should be correlated with its performance.

However, it's important to keep in mind that if a variation was recently added, ezbot may not have enough data to serve it at the optimal percentage yet.

### Conversion Rate Improvement

The conversion rate improvement graph shows how each **combination** is performing relative to the **holdback** (or **combination** with all default values). These can be positive or negative, depending on whether each **combination** works better or worse than your original site.

Right now, all combinations are shown on the graph. In the future, we will add the ability to filter by **attribute** or **variation**.

## Raw Data

Raw data is available upon request. If you would like your data to be sent to you, please reach out to [support@ezbot.ai](mailto:support@ezbot.ai).
