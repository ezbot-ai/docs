## What Do These Graphs Mean?

### Traffic Distribution

The traffic distribution graph shows what percentage of your traffic is receiving each **variation**. Generally, you should expect the best (highest-performing) **variations** to have larger amounts of traffic served to them. In other words, the traffic distribution percentage of a variation should be corrlated with its performance.

However, it's important to keep in mind that if a variation was recently added, ezbot may not have enough data to serve it at the optimal percentage yet.

### Conversion Rate Improvement

The conversion rate improvement graph shows how each **variation** is performing relative to the **holdback** variation or your original website. These can be positive or negative, depending on whether each **variation** works better or worse than your original site.
