Next, you will be directed to either create a new organization or join an existing organization. If you were invited to join ezbot by an organization, you will see it as an option to join. If not, you will be directed to create an organization.

—_Please bear with us while we update the pictures in this section to reflect the most up-to-date user interface._—

To create an organization, you will need to start a subscription through Stripe. There are monthly and annual prices. All subscriptions come with a risk-free one month trial.

Once you have filled out your payment and organization information on Stripe, you will be directed back to the onboarding flow.
