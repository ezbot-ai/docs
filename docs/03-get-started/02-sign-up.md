Next, you will be prompted to either create a new organization or join an existing one. If you were invited to join an organization, you will see it as an option. If not, you will be directed to create a new organization.

To create an organization, you will need to start a subscription through Stripe. We offer both monthly and annual pricing options. All subscriptions come with a risk-free one-month trial.

Once you have completed your payment and organization information on Stripe, you will be directed back to the onboarding flow.
