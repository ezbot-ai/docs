# Web Tracker Installation

To begin tracking your users, you must first decide whether you want to use the JavaScript Snippet _or_ the JavaScript SDK.

## JavaScript Snippet

The easiest way to install ezbot is to use our JavaScript Snippet. The JavaScript Snippet is a small piece of code that you add to your website. It will automatically load the ezbot library and start tracking your users.

If you're using a website builder like Wix, Squarespace, or WebFlow and you don't have access or the desire to modify your source code, the JavaScript Snippet is the best way to get started.

<details>  
<summary>**JS Snippet Pros/Cons**</summary>  
<div> 
<p>**Pros**</p> 
<ul>
    <li>Easy to install</li>
    <li>Works with any website builder</li>
    <li>Doesn't require a developer</li>
    <li>Enables our Visual Editor</li>
</ul>
<p>**Cons**</p>   
<ul>
    <li>Only supports experimentation with our Visual Editor</li>
    <li>Limited number of visual changes supported at this time</li>
    <li>Can affect page load performance more than the JS SDK</li>
    <li>Can cause content to change after page load, though most users don't notice it</li>
</ul>
</div>  
</details>

To use the JavaScript Snippet, follow one of the installation methods below.

If you need help installing the JavaScript Snippet, please contact us at [support@ezbot.ai](mailto:support@ezbot.ai).

### Google Tag Manager (GTM)

If you already have Google Tag Manager installed, you can install ezbot with just a few clicks. [Follow the steps in our new GTM Installation Guide here.](../04-guides/installation/03-google-tag-manager.md)

### Common Website Builders

If you're using a website builder like Shopify or WordPress, we've written guides for you to install ezbot:

- [Shopify](../04-guides/installation/04-shopify.md)
- [WordPress](../04-guides/installation/05-wordpress.md)

### Other Installation Methods

You can find guides for other JavaScript Snippet installation methods [here](/category/installation).

## JavaScript SDK

If you're a developer and you want to integrate ezbot directly into your website or app, you can use our JavaScript SDK. The JavaScript SDK is a more powerful and performant way to integrate ezbot and gives you more control over how you use the platform.

<details>  
<summary>**JS SDK Pros/Cons**</summary>  
<div> 
<p>**Pros**</p> 
<ul>
    <li>Control any aspect of your frontend</li>
    <li>Most performant installation</li>
    <li>Also enables our Visual Editor</li>
</ul>
<p>**Cons**</p>   
<ul>
    <li>Requires a developer (or someone who can code) to add and use **variations** in your website or app's language.</li>
    <li>Does not support Node (server-side) yet.</li>
</ul>
</div>  
</details>

To install the JavaScript SDK, please see the Basic JavaScript SDK installation guide [here](../04-guides/installation/06-basic-sdk.md).

### Common JS Frameworks

If you're using a common JS framework like NextJS, we've written guides for you to install ezbot:
