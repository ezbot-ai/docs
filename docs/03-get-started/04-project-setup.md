# Project Setup

## Create a project

After [you've signed-up, created an organization, and started a subscription](./02-sign-up.md), you're next step is to create a project.

Each **organization** can have multiple **projects**. **Projects** contain variables, variations, attributes, and settings like **holdback percentage**.Projects are an organizational tool to keep your data within a certain scope – apart from other data. For best results with ezbot, use as few projects as possible.

To create a new project, you must set the following:

## Choose your holdback percentage

The holdback percentage is the percentage of traffic that should receive only default values. ezbot uses your holdback traffic to compare the performance of your variations to the default values. The holdback percentage will vary depending on your organizations goals. The following are useful to consider when determining a holdback percentage:

- Risk Aversion
- Number of Variations tested
- Amount of Traffic not in Holdback

:::tip

Start with a holdback percentage that you're comfortable with. You can always adjust it later. Once you have confidence in ezbot, we recommend a holdback percentage of 5-10%.
