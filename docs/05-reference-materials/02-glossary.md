<summary>**Variable**</summary>  
<div>  
<div>A variable is the basic building block of a user experience. It is the thing you want to change, test, and improve upon. It can be anything from a button to the entire layout of a page. To get the most out of ezbot, you should focus your variables on a single change --- like the text in one button --- rather than making several changes in one variable. This will allow ezbot to explore the most combinations.  </div>

Examples 
</summary>  
<div> **Button Color:**  </div>

<details>  
<summary>**Variation**</summary>  
<div>  
<div>A variation is each of the changes made on one variable.  Each variable can have different values you want to test. Imagine these as possibilities or choices. For example, if your variable is "button color," you might have variations like red, blue, and green. The more variations you explore, the more freedom Ezbot has to explore.  </div>  
<br/>

Examples 
</summary>  
<div> If your variable is "button color", then your variations are "red", "blue", and "green".</div>

<summary>**Attribute**</summary>  
<div>  
<div>These are like extra clues about your users that help Ezbot personalize their experiences. This can be as simple as telling us “this user is a paying customer” or “this user isn’t logged in”. You can also share things like known audience(s) they belong to, purchase history, or whether they’re in a beta group. </div>

<div>  
<div>It's like sending us a thumbs-up! Whenever your users take an action you want them to (like buying something or adding an item to their cart), we need a signal to understand how each combination of variations is performing. </div>

<summary>**Prediction**</summary>  
<div>  
<div>Ezbot personalizes your UX like a master chef crafting the perfect dish. By subtly changing elements like button colors, text, or layouts (think: ingredients!), Ezbot tests different combinations ("recipes") to see what resonates with each user. When you initialize our code, it creates a unique session ID and requests a personalized "recipe" or set of variable predictions for each visitor. Simply integrate these suggestions into your code to deliver an optimized & personalized experience for everyone who visits your site. </div>

<details>  
<summary>**Holdback**</summary>  
<div>  
<div>This is like a control group in a science experiment. We compare how users in the optimized group performs compared to the holdback group. The optimized group shows both the default variations and the variations you are testing. The holdback groups only shows the default variations. </div>
<br/>  
<div>Having a holdback group helps us measure the relative impact of your experimentation efforts. You control how much traffic goes to the holdback group (e.g., 20%) either to balance risk or maximize your potential ROI from ezbot. See more about how to decide on your holdback percentage in Step 4 of Getting Started. </div>

<summary>**Project**</summary>  
<div>  
<div> An **organization** can have multiple **projects** if their subscription is active. **Projects** hold all of the data you need for a given set of experiments on your website or app. Each **organization** can have multiple **projects**. **Projects** contain variables, variations, attributes, and holdback settings.  This is an organizational tool to keep your data in a bucket that is scoped to each project. For best results with ezbot, an organization have as few projects as possible.  </div>
