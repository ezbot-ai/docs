## Using the Visual Editor

### Modes

The Visual Editor has two modes: **interactive** and **ezbot**.

1. **Interactive Mode:** Allows you to interact with your website as a user, useful for navigating to other pages to add or edit visual changes.
2. **ezbot Mode:** Allows you to highlight elements on your website to make visual changes.

### Highlighting

When highlighting is enabled, elements on your website that have visual changes, along with the active element you clicked on, will be highlighted in the Visual Editor. You can enable or disable highlighting by clicking the **Highlight** button in the toolbar.

### Shuffle

When shuffle is enabled, ezbot will randomly shuffle through the variations of your visual variables to show you how different combinations will look. This is a helpful way to demo ezbot's capabilities without having to wait for users to visit your site.

- **Text**: Change the text of an element.
