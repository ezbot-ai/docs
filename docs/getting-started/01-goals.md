# Goals

At ezbot, weâ€™re on a mission to give people everywhere the power to test their ideas and eradicate bad user experiences on all websites and apps. We built ezbot to help businesses focus on the details that matter most.

Instead of carving up traffic first and running experiments to learn what works for whom, ezbot allows businesses to improve KPIs first, and dig into the details later. By directing ezbot to maximize the goals of your website, businesses can deliver winning user experiences to their customers quickly and easily.

ezbot was formed around two key premises:

1. **People are terrible at predicting which user experience will perform best** (see guessthetest.com).
2. **The #1 predictor of ROI on experimentation programs is the number of variations tested.**

Because of this, ezbot prioritizes making it easy for you to test as many variations as possible in order to deliver as much value as possible.

# Benefits of Optimizing with ezbot

### Get Started Quickly and Easily

ezbot works on any website with any framework, so users can get started quickly. Signing up and installing ezbot is very simple, so users can start using ezbot the day they sign up.

If you want to use the visual (WYSIWYG) editor, then you'll need to install the JavaScript Snipper or node SDK.

If you want to use the REST API directly, you do not need to install anything.

### No More Guessing: Learn What Actually Works

With traditional experimentation tools, users have to guess which variations will perform best so they can run as few experiments as possible. with ezbot, people can try out all of their ideas and find out what works best without having to limit their creativity or guess the results of experiments before they're even run.
