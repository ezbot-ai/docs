# Benefits of Optimizing with ezbot

### Get Started Quickly and Easily

ezbot works on any website with any framework, so users can get started quickly. Signing up and installing ezbot is very simple, so users can start using ezbot the day they sign up.

If you want to use the visual (WYSIWYG) editor, then you'll need to install the JavaScript Snipper or node SDK.

If you want to use the REST API directly, you do not need to install anything.

### No More Guessing: Try Everything and Learn What Actually Works

With traditional experimentation tools, users have to guess which variations will perform best so they can run as few experiments as possible. With ezbot, people can try out all of their ideas and find out which ones actually work best. Ezbot does not need you to limit your creativity or guess the results of experiments before they're even run.

### One Size Does Not Fit All

Most experiments today are run in order to find out which single version of your website will perform best overall. This means that the "winner" of your experiments will be served to everyone that lands on your site.

However, ezbot understands that not everyone has the same preferences. In an [example](03-how-it-works.md) on the next page, you can see how different users may have different preferences for hats or other clothing types based on the weather in their locations. With ezbot, your website can differentiate between different kinds of users and serve them different website based on their preferences.

### User Preferences Change

When experiments are run in the traditional way, they have a start and an end date. This means that when an experiment is over no more data will be taken into account and if user preferences change you won't know it unless you run new experiments.

Since ezbot never stops keeping track of what works for users on your website, it will adapt quickly to changing user preferences. If, for example, an item goes our of style or a change in the weather causes user preferences to change, ezbot will notice and figure out which website variation works best to match these new preferences.
