# ezbot.ai docs

Welcome to ezbot's public documentation repository. This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Manage Docs Versions

Docusaurus can manage multiple versions of your docs.

#### Create a docs version

Release a version 1.0 of your project:

```bash
npm run docusaurus docs:version 1.0
```

The `docs` folder is copied into `versioned_docs/version-1.0` and `versions.json` is created.

Your docs now have 2 versions:

- `1.0` at `http://localhost:3000/docs/` for the version 1.0 docs
- `current` at `http://localhost:3000/docs/next/` for the **upcoming, unreleased docs**

#### Update an existing version

It is possible to edit versioned docs in their respective folder:

- `versioned_docs/version-1.0/hello.md` updates `http://localhost:3000/docs/hello`
- `docs/hello.md` updates `http://localhost:3000/docs/next/hello`


### Build

```
$ npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
